# FOODIEGO-PWA

It is a Simple CRUD Based WebApp build using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, Materialize UI and CSS. I deployed using Firebase. I have used Firestore as my Database.


## To Check the Live WebApp
[FoodieGo](https://foodiego-82820.web.app/)

## Features
* Full responsiveness and browser compatibility.
* Connectivity independence (Can work both Online and Offline)
* Native App-like interface
* Self-updates
* Discoverability and easy installation (Platform Independent)

## Method Of Converting A WebAPP to PWA
* Manifest File is a JSON File which deals with the UI capabilities 
* Service Worker File is a JavaScript File. By using event based triggers we can cache our Static and Dynamic Asset's. Also leverages IndexDB as a local database which tracks data updates while offline or online and make changes in the server database accordingly.
